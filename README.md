# urlescraper

Inspired by this [repo](https://github.com/Dinoosauro/node-tiktok-to-ytdlp/tree/main) and this [repo](https://github.com/Dinoosauro/tiktok-to-ytdlp).

For now two scripts:
- script to scroll to end
- script to fetch all links and download txt file

## TODO:
- improve link scraper
- save txt with name of user and number of links
- yt-dlp download names of files only the ID
